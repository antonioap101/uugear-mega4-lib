A C++17 library for controlling the [**UUGear MEGA4**](https://www.uugear.com/product/mega4-4-port-usb-3-1-ppps-hub-for-raspberry-pi-4b/) ‚Äî  
a 4-port USB 3.1 PPPS hub with per-port power switching, designed for **Raspberry Pi 4B** and compatible embedded systems.

This library provides a minimal interface on top of [**libusb**](https://libusb.info)  
to query, power-toggle and inspect devices connected to MEGA4 hubs programmatically.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Detect connected **MEGA4 hubs** automatically  
- **Turn ON/OFF power** on each individual USB port  
- Query **real-time port power states**  
- Enumerate and identify **devices connected to each port**  
- Cross-platform (Linux, ARM boards such as Rock Pi S / Raspberry Pi)

---

## üß† Examples

Ready-to-run examples are available in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory. They demonstrate how to:

- Detect connected **MEGA4 hubs**
- Enumerate devices connected to each port
- Query **port power states**
- Toggle power **ON/OFF** on individual ports

You can build and run the example with:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -t toggle_port
./build/toggle_port
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Using **FetchContent** (recommended)

Add this to your project‚Äôs `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    uugear_mega4_lib
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/antonioap101/uugear-mega4-lib.git
    GIT_TAG master
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(uugear_mega4_lib)

target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE uugear_mega4_lib)
```

The library will be automatically downloaded and built with your project.

### Building standalone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonioaparicio/uugear-mega4-lib.git
cd uugear-mega4-lib
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build
```

### Dependencies

* [libusb 1.0.26+](https://libusb.info)
* CMake ‚â• 3.16
* A C++17 compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
